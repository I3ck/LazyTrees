LazyTrees
==========
A C++ library for lazy tree structures.
`LazyTrees` offers lazy search trees (e.g. KD-Tree). Usually such trees are fully-built and can then be used to search nearest neighbours efficently. 
The drawback is that the tree has to be built, which can be rather time consuming. A lazy tree will only be built once needed and even then only its affected branches.
